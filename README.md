# Supermarket Billing System

Welcome to the Supermarket Billing System, a C++ application that simplifies the process of managing customer purchases and generating invoices for a supermarket. 
This project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a user-friendly billing system.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Easily add, modify, or remove products from the system's inventory.
- **Customer Shopping**: Simulate customer shopping by selecting items and specifying quantities.
- **Automatic Invoice Generation**: The system calculates the total cost, applies discounts, and generates detailed invoices.
- **Billing History**: Maintain a record of all transactions and billing history.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple interface that is easy to use.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `App.c++` file using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled program to start the supermarket billing system.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage products, process customer purchases, and generate invoices.

## How It Works

The Supermarket Billing System uses C++ classes and objects to represent products, customers, and invoices. It allows you to:

- Add new products to the inventory with details such as name, price, and quantity.
- Create customer transactions by selecting products and specifying quantities.
- Calculate the total cost, apply discounts (if any), and generate invoices.
- Maintain a history of transactions and billing records.

## Acknowledgments

This supermarket billing system was developed as a learning exercise in C++ and object-oriented programming. It aims to demonstrate the practical application of OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.

Enjoy using the Supermarket Billing System, and feel free to customize it to meet your specific supermarket's needs or further expand its capabilities!
